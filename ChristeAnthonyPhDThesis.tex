%% The options are (you can only choose one from each group):
%%
%% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt: chooses the point size for the document. "11ot" is the
%%                   default.
%%
%% oneside, twoside: whether you want your document onesided or twosided. Note
%%                   that twosided is not guaranteed to work, and style
%%                   guidelines prohibit double sided printouts on final
%%                   copy. "oneside" is the default.
%%
%% draft, final: when printing drafts you can save a lot of paper by using the
%%               "draft" option. It switches to single spacing, displays overful
%%               hboxes with a black box, prints a version number on title page
%%               and omits signature page. Of course for the final copy make
%%               sure to use the "final" option! "final" is the default.
%%
%% cm, times, palatino, newcent, bookman: switches between different font
%%                                        sets. "cm" is the Computer Modern
%%                                        font (TeX's default), the rest are
%%                                        PostScript fonts. "times" is the
%%                                        default.
%%
%% thesis, dissertation: switches between the style for a master's thesis and a
%%                       Ph.D. dissertation. The differences are fairly minor
%%                       and limited to the front matter. "thesis" is the
%%                       default.
%%
%% actual, proposal: switches between actual document and proposal mode. In
%%                   proposal mode: the title page is simplified, the
%%                   version number is always printed, and the signature page
%%                   is omitted.

%%% Load the uhthesis2e document class
\documentclass[11pt, draft, dissertation, proposal]{uhthesis}

%%% Load some useful packages:
%% New LaTeX2e graphics support
\usepackage{graphicx}
%% Package to linebreak URLs in a sane manner.
\usepackage{url}

%%% Declarations for Front Matter. Capitalize all of these values
%%% "normally". This allows the document class to format them properly.
%% Full title of thesis or dissertation, capitalized like a title should be.
\title{todo}
%% Your name, capitalized normally. Do not include any titles like Dr.
\author{Anthony J. Christe}
%% Month in which you intend to receive your degree (i.e. graduation).
%% Presumably this will be one of: May, August, or December.
\degreemonth{todo}
%% Year of expected graduation.
\degreeyear{todo}
%% Type of degree to be conferred.
\degree{PhD}
%% This is the chairperson of your committee. Do not use titles like Dr.
\chair{Philip Johnson and Milton Garces}
%% The other members of your committee, seperated by "\\". Again, no titles,
%% and it is customary to list the outside committee member (if you have one)
%% last.
\othermembers{todo}
%% This is the total size of your committee, including the chairperson. The
%% signature page routine will only handle up to 6 members; if you have more
%% than that you will need to modify the document class.
%%\numberofmembers{4}
%% The field in which you are obtaining your degree, capitalized normally.
\field{Information and Computer Sciences}
%\subfield{Bioinformatics}
%% The version number of your document. Consistent use of this will enable you
%% to tell old drafts from new ones. Final actual documents omit this
%% automatically so you can use it without fear of submission problems at the
%% end. If you do not define this parameter, it defaults to "1.0.0".
