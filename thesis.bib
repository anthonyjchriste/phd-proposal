In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 × 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 1021 bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58\%. The world’s capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28\% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23\%). Humankind’s capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6\%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9\% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94\% digital in 2007).},

Many applications of sensor networks need local clocks of sensor nodes to be synchronized, requiring various degrees of precision.

Hence, there has been an increasing research focus on designing synchronization algorithms specifically for sensor networks.

	abstract = {Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have emerged as an interesting and important research area in the last few years. The applications envisioned for such networks require collaborative execution of a distributed task amongst a large set of sensor nodes. This is realized by exchanging messages that are time-stamped using the local clocks on the nodes. Therefore, time synchronization becomes an indispensable piece of infrastructure in such systems. For years, protocols such as NTP have kept the clocks of networked systems in perfect synchrony. However, this new class of networks has a large density of nodes and very limited energy resource at every node; this leads to scalability requirements while limiting the resources that can be used to achieve them. A new approach to time synchronization is needed for sensor networks.In this paper, we present Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor Networks (TPSN) that aims at providing network-wide time synchronization in a sensor network. The algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, a hierarchical structure is established in the network and then a pair wise synchronization is performed along the edges of this structure to establish a global timescale throughout the network. Eventually all nodes in the network synchronize their clocks to a reference node. We implement our algorithm on Berkeley motes and show that it can synchronize a pair of neighboring motes to an average accuracy of less than 20ms. We argue that TPSN roughly gives a 2x better performance as compared to Reference Broadcast Synchronization (RBS) and verify this by implementing RBS on motes. We also show the performance of TPSN over small multihop networks of motes and use simulations to verify its accuracy over large-scale networks. We show that the synchronization accuracy does not degrade significantly with the increase in number of nodes being deployed, making TPSN completely scalable.},

In this paper, we present tri-message: a lightweight time synchronization protocol for high latency and resource-constrained networks. As its name suggests, only three message exchanges are required in one synchronization process. Meanwhile, tri-message utilizes very simple mathematical operations to calculate the clock skew and offset. Specially, tri-message is feasible for many extremely long latency applications such as space exploration because it has an increasing synchronization precision with the increasement of distance.},
